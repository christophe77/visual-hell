## 📜 The Design Philosophy Behind VISUAL HELL

### 🖼️ The Bold Choice of Papyrus Font

We use **Papyrus**, a font that **boldly defies** modern typography trends. While some may argue for readability, we **prioritize uniqueness**. **Nobody else dares to use Papyrus**—so we do.

### 🎨 The Color Palette: A Visual Masterpiece

- **Lime text on hot pink** = High contrast for better readability\*
- **Neon cyan buttons with pink dashed borders** = Attention-grabbing without being distracting\*
- **Black footer with wavy purple underlines** = A stylish, futuristic aesthetic

(\*None of this is backed by actual research.)

### 🎭 Animations That Keep You Awake

Who needs **boring, subtle** animations? Instead, we embrace:

- **Infinite shaking effects** – Keeps users engaged (and slightly nauseous).
- **360° text rotation** – Adds **dynamic storytelling** to simple text.
- **Background color changing every 200ms** – Because the human eye loves **constant stimulation**.

### 🎰 The Random Message Generator

Every **5 seconds**, the website **spits out** a **randomly encoded base64 message**, decoded in real-time.  
Why? Because **predictability is boring**. And also **because we can**.

### 🎠 The Worst Carousel Ever Made

- **No controls**? ✅
- **No indicators**? ✅
- **No logic to image order**? ✅
- **Random images from the root folder with zero optimization**? ✅

This is **true innovation** in carousel design.

### 🎤 Text-To-Speech Because Why Not?

The website **randomly speaks messages out loud** at **random intervals**.  
This is **a next-gen accessibility feature** for **maximum unpredictability**.

### ⛔ A “Do Not Click” Button That Destroys Everything

Hidden somewhere on the page is a **mysterious button**.  
Clicking it will **erase everything** and display a **giant red "YOU BROKE IT" message**.  
Why? Because **true UX is about creating emotions**—including **regret**.
